## FAQ

- Will this automatically verify emails?
  - Yes, the script will automatically fetch the verification link from the email, and use it to verify the account.

- Can I log in to the accounts, on the web, after generating them?
  - Yes, that is how this script is intended to be used. Simply copy the email address and password from the CSV file and log in to the account.

- There are multiple passwords in the CSV file. Which one should I use?
  - As of May 2024, all columns have appropriate headers.
  - You will need to use the password in the second columns titled `MEGA Password`.

- What's with the other password then? And why do I need the `Mail.tm ID`?
  - The other password, in the `Mail.tm Password` column, is the password for the Mail.tm account.
  - You can use this password to sign in to the temporary Mail.tm account on their website.
  - In order to access the Mail.tm account, through their API, we also need the ID of the account. This is stored in the case it will be needed in the future.

- What's with the `-p`/`--password` flag? Do I need it?
  - The `-p` flag is optional.
  - You can use this to specify a password for all accounts. If not specified, a random password will be generated for each account.

- Can I generate multiple accounts in parallel?
  - Yes, this script can generate multiple accounts in parallel using the `-t` flag.
  - This is, however, not recommended, and will likely result in rate limits from Mail.tm.
  - The script will automatically retry in the event of a rate limit up to 5 times.

- Why can I only run 8 threads?
  - Because of rate limits from Mail.tm.
  - We do not want to overload their service, which they generously offer for free.

- Something is broken? I'm having trouble using this script.
  - Please [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/hexxedspider/MEGA-Account-Generator/issues). Be sure to include information and screenshots.

## Acknowledgements

This software was based heavily on [IceWreck/MegaScripts](https://github.com/IceWreck/MegaScripts).<br>
His original Python script utilized [GuerillaMail](https://www.guerrillamail.com/GuerrillaMailAPI.html) to generate temporary email addresses.<br>
I've modified the script to use [Mail.tm](https://api.mail.tm/) instead, with a lot of help from [qtchaos/py_mega_account_generator](https://github.com/qtchaos/py_mega_account_generator).<br>
I highly recommend checking out both of their projects.<br><br>
This script was forked from f-o, so majority of the code is from them.


## Support
The original script was created by [f-o](https://github.com/f-o), and I only forked and added to it.<br>
